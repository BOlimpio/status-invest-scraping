# status-invest-scraping :hourglass_flowing_sand:
This is a Python script that scrapes information about Stocks or REITs from the statusinvest.com.br website. It retrieves data such as stock price, P/VP (Price-to-Net Asset Value Ratio), P/L (Price-to-Earnings Ratio), DY (Dividend Yield) for a list of specified codes

## Dependencies
The script requires the following Python packages to be installed:

- requests
- BeautifulSoup
- pandas

You can install these dependencies using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Work in progress :hourglass_flowing_sand:

## Notes :warning:

- The script assumes the website structure remains the same. If there are any changes to the website's HTML structure or class names, the script may need to be updated accordingly.
- The script only uses public information
- It's important to respect website scraping policies and avoid overloading the website with frequent requests. Consider adding delays between requests if scraping a large number of Stocks/REITs.
